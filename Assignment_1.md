In python programming language there are few linting tools like pylint and flake8. Flake8 which finds style errors and reads out where they are coming from for you. However, flake8 does not fix any of these formatting issues. It just tells you where they are. Pylint in otherhand is a Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard, looks for code and offers simple refactoring suggestions. And testing tools for Python progamming language includes pytest and codecov for instance. Pytest is a very easy to use and Pythonic testing library for Python projects. Pytest is also very flexible and can handle most testing requirements you could need. Codecov is a framework that keeps track of the percentage of lines of your code that are executed by your unit tests. This helps give you an understanding of where you are testing and most importantly where your testing is lacking.

Alternatives for setting up CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions includes GitLab, Atlassian Bamboo, CircleCI, TeamCity, Travis CI, BuildMaster, Bitrise, Spinnaker and many more.

One of the major differences between using a managed CI/CD service and running your own self-hosted services is infrastructure management. CI/CD systems require resources to run and, as with any infrastructure, this means that someone has to maintain the health of the services and the underlying host systems. Managed services are completely hosted and supervised by an external organization offering CI/CD capabilities. The external organization takes responsibility for running and scaling their services, maintaining the health of their server fleet, and providing access to the services in a secure and easy to consume way. If you are self-hosting your CI/CD systems, you will be responsible for making infrastructure decisions, keeping the underlying servers healthy by servicing hardware and patching software, and ensuring the services are available, secure, and performing adequately. Cloud-based environment Should be better for large projects with many people working on it. Its much faster to set up and it probably has enough resources to our project.
